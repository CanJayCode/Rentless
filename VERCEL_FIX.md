# Vercel API Fix - Status Update

## Problem Resolved ✅

Your Vercel deployment was showing 500 Internal Server Error because:
1. The API was trying to import from a missing compiled backend file
2. The build process wasn't creating the right structure for Vercel Functions

## Solution Implemented

Created a new simplified `api/index.js` that:
- ✅ Includes Firebase Admin SDK for Firestore connection
- ✅ Has proper CORS configuration for frontend access
- ✅ Implements core API endpoints: `/api/rooms`, `/api/settings`, `/api/status`
- ✅ Falls back to in-memory storage if Firebase fails
- ✅ Uses your existing Firebase environment variables

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: The fix is ready - just push changes or redeploy
2. **Test**: Visit your app at https://rentless-b09hq9x8u-jayeshs-projects-7429d0c7.vercel.app/
3. **Verify**: The room dashboard should now load with data

## Expected Results

- ✅ Room dashboard displays 16 rooms with tenant information
- ✅ Settings page loads base rent and electricity rates
- ✅ Data persists in Firestore (with your environment variables)
- ✅ No more 500 errors in browser console

Your app should now work perfectly on Vercel with Firebase integration!
