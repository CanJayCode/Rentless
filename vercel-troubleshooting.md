# Vercel App Working - Next Steps

Excellent! Your Firebase environment variables are now set up in Vercel. Here's what's happening and how to verify everything works:

## Current Status âœ…
- **Frontend**: Deployed and accessible at your Vercel URL
- **Backend API**: Deployed as Vercel Functions 
- **Firebase**: Environment variables configured
- **Database**: Should now be connecting to Firestore

## Quick Test

1. **Visit your app**: https://rentless-b09hq9x8u-jayeshs-projects-7429d0c7.vercel.app/
2. **Check if data loads**: The dashboard should now show rooms and allow you to manage payments
3. **Test functionality**: Try updating a room's rent or electricity payment

## If You See Vercel Authentication Screen

The Vercel authentication screen appears because:
- Your deployment might have protection enabled
- Or you're accessing API endpoints directly

**Solution**: Always access your app through the main URL, not the API endpoints directly.

## Verify Database Connection

Once you can access your app, check if:
- Room data appears on the dashboard
- You can update rent/electricity payments
- Settings page works
- Data persists when you refresh

## If Data Still Doesn't Load

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel to redeploy with new environment variables
2. **Check Vercel logs** in your dashboard for any errors
3. **Verify Firestore database** is created in Firebase Console

## Need Help?

If you're still seeing issues, let me know:
- What you see when you visit the main app URL
- Any error messages
- Whether the dashboard shows rooms or is blank

Your migration is complete - the app should now work perfectly!
